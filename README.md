# Predicting-crop-yield-with-NDVI-and-Backscatter-values-using-DNN-
Agriculture is India's major cause of income and even plays a critical part in ensuring food security in the Indian economy. India's agricultural sector faces the tough problem of maximizing crop productivity. A common problem for Indian farmers is not selecting the right crops based on their soil needs. This has an impact on productivity. Predicting yield before harvest helps farmers take appropriate trading and repository measures. This work assists agronomists to realize the yield of crops before planting them on their farmland. Consequently, it guides farmers in taking the right decisions. Deep learning (DL) can be an important consideration in obtaining an effective solution for yield forecasting. This study is primarily based on providing accurate yield prediction with a focus on key crops. The deep Neural Network (DNN) model is employed for predicting the crop yield.
